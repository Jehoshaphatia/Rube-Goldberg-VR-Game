# VR Nanodegree - Unity High Immersion - Rube Goldberg Challenge
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Screenshot.png?raw=true "Gameplay")

## Overview
This project was a chance for me to create my first fully-functional multi-platform high-immersion VR game. The goal of this project was to create a Rube Goldberg game that challenges players to advance through 4 levels of increasing difficulty by solving physics-based puzzles. Build Rube Goldberg contraptions to get the ball from the starting platform to the goal, collecting all of the stars along the way. If the ball hits the ground the puzzle is reset.

First I imported SteamVR and set up up my scene environment. Then my task was to add locomotion, grabbing physics, and a menu system. I used my skills to create a number of unique objects and levels.

## Some Challenges

One of my most notable challenges was preventing the player from being able to teleport outside the room.

## Skills utilized
This project was about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Adding SteamVR and the Oculus SDK to a Unity Project
* Designing gameplay for 6DOF hand controllers
* Creating teleport or similar locomotion mechanics
* Creating object grabbing and throwing code
* Creating a menu system with hand controllers and Vector2 input
* Creating seamless VR scene loading
* Designing anti-cheat mechanisms
* Integrating SteamVR and Oculus input handling in the same project
* Creating dynamic 3D objects
